    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">How to play?</h1>
    <p>In every game, understanding its core elements is key to success. Begin by grasping the main goal—whether it’s achieving victory, completing missions, surviving challenges, or exploring the world. Familiarize yourself with the game’s controls, such as movement, actions, and special abilities, as well as the interface, which displays important information like health, stamina, resources, and objectives.
<br><br>
        Take the time to understand the unique mechanics of the game, such as crafting systems, combat styles, or interaction with the environment. Explore the map thoroughly to locate essential areas, resources, or safe zones while keeping an eye out for hidden secrets or shortcuts. Many games involve progression, so focus on leveling up, earning rewards, unlocking new abilities, or upgrading equipment to improve your performance.
        <br><br>
        Equally important is your strategy—observe patterns, analyze enemy behavior, and adapt your approach based on the situation. Team-based games require good communication and role understanding, while solo games may emphasize problem-solving and exploration. Lastly, patience and practice are critical. Learn from your mistakes, experiment with different techniques, and refine your skills to enjoy and master the game fully.
